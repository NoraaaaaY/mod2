1. I think the most challenging accessibility enhancements to implement is adding label for the input fields since I am not familiar with the function so that I often make typing error. Also make the color AAA contracting is challenging because I dont have a sense of color.
2. For users relying on assistive technologies, ARIA attributes clarifys the role of each elements and the relationship between each elements.
3. What tools did you use to check color contrast, and how did they help? I used WebAIM Contrast Checker to check the contrast level, it could help me check the contrast ratio of 2 colors, so I keep changing color to find the higher contrast ratio one.
